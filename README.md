# CT Omni Channel

CT Omni Channel is a custom indicator designed to identify over-extensions and potential trends in the financial markets. It calculates and plots a dynamic channel based on the provided price data, allowing traders to make informed trading decisions.

## Indicator Initialization

The `OnInit()` function is called when the indicator is initialized. In this function, the indicator buffers are mapped, and the indicator line is set to empty. The short name of the indicator is also set to 'CT Omni Channel'.

## Indicator Calculation

The `OnCalculate()` function is called for each new bar in the price data. It calculates the indicator values and determines whether a buy or sell signal should be triggered based on the channel calculations.

The function starts by calculating the number of new bars (`limit`) that need to be processed. It then loops through each bar and performs the following steps:

1. Calculates the channel top and bottom using the `CalculateChannelTop()` and `CalculateChannelBottom()` functions.
2. Checks if the closing price of the current bar is above the channel top. If true, it triggers the buy signal actions by calling the `PerformBuySignalActions()` function.
3. Checks if the closing price of the current bar is below the channel bottom. If true, it triggers the sell signal actions by calling the `PerformSellSignalActions()` function.

## Channel Calculation

The `CalculateChannelTop()` and `CalculateChannelBottom()` functions are responsible for calculating the channel top and bottom values based on the provided index and trading strategy. In this sample code, the channel top is calculated as the highest price of the current bar, and the channel bottom is calculated as the lowest price of the current bar.

## Signal Actions

The `PerformBuySignalActions()` and `PerformSellSignalActions()` functions are placeholders for the actual buy and sell signal actions. Traders can implement their own logic within these functions to execute specific trading actions when a buy or sell signal is triggered.
